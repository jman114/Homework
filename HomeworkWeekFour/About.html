       <h2>Capstone Idea Definition Statement</h2>
      <p>I want to build an application that allows hairstylists and barbers to sign up for a service (much like an uber driver) to go mobile and cut people’s hair at home. The application will also allow users to search through the stylist available by location and make appointments/rate the service they received and pay/tip on with the application.
      </p>
    <h2>Capstone Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <P>Hi I’m James McMinn, a Savvy Coders student in St. Louis, Missouri. It’s great to meet you!<br><br>

        Since you work with the top investing firm in St. Louis I figured you’d be interested to know that millions of people can't get haircuts for various reasons.<br><br>
        
        The thing that makes them similar is they simply can't get to the salon or barbershop. 90% of people say they wish there was another way to get a haircut.<br><br>
        
        The great part about being a Savvy Coder's student is that I've been able to fix their problem with a new Uber-Like app where stylists or barbers will come to your home to cut your hair.<br><br>
        
        In fact, my app is one of the only apps that offers a service to get your haircut at home on demand.<br><br>
        
        I think my app could be beneficial to your investment firm as well as myself. Are you available this week to speak further on this?”</P>
